and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

### Added
- **Lift request lifecycle management**: Requests are now first-class entities with explicit lifecycle states
- `LiftRequest` domain model with unique ID, type, origin, destination, and direction
- `RequestState` enum with six lifecycle states: CREATED, QUEUED, ASSIGNED, SERVING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- `RequestType` enum to distinguish between HALL_CALL and CAR_CALL requests
- State transition validation ensuring only valid request state changes occur
- Factory methods `LiftRequest.hallCall()` and `LiftRequest.carCall()` for creating requests
- Terminal state detection with `isTerminal()` method
- Comprehensive unit tests for request lifecycle (LiftRequestTest, LiftRequestLifecycleTest)
- ADR-0003 documenting request lifecycle architectural decision

### Changed
- `NaiveLiftController` now manages requests as `LiftRequest` objects internally
- Controller automatically advances requests through lifecycle states (CREATED → QUEUED → ASSIGNED → SERVING → COMPLETED)
- Completed and cancelled requests are automatically removed from the controller
- Backward compatibility maintained: `addCarCall()` and `addHallCall()` methods still work

### Design Decisions
- Every request must end in either COMPLETED or CANCELLED state (terminal states)
- Invalid state transitions throw `IllegalStateException`
- Self-transitions are prevented
- Terminal states cannot transition to any other state
- Request state progression is automatically managed by the controller

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- Added configurable door dwell timing with automatic door close cycles
- Extended simulation engine timing tests to cover door dwell and closing transitions

### Changed
- Door cycles now automatically progress from open to closing after the dwell duration

### Fixed
- Align door closing timing from dwell with door transition tick consumption

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- Introduced a deterministic simulation clock to manage tick progression
- Added configurable travel and door transition durations to model time per floor
- Expanded unit tests to validate tick-based movement and door timing
- Added a deterministic simulation regression test for fixed inputs

### Changed
- Movement and door transitions now consume configured ticks before completing

## [0.2.9] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- Configure Maven to use Java release targeting to avoid module path warnings
- Explicitly set the resources plugin encoding for filtered properties files

## [0.2.8] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Keep the naive controller idle while doors are closing to avoid invalid move attempts

## [0.2.7] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- Print the running software version in the demo output

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Keep the NaiveLiftController idle during door opening to prevent invalid move attempts
- Clear same-floor requests while doors are opening to avoid redundant open commands

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Clear same-floor requests while doors are opening or open to avoid extra open/close cycles

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Ensure the NaiveLiftController stops before opening doors when arriving at a requested floor while moving

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- Include lift status in the NaiveLiftController demo output so transitional states are visible

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- Align door-opening test flow with state machine requirements before attempting to move down

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- Add missing `LiftStatus` import in `SimulationEngineTest` to restore test compilation

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- Introduced formal lift state machine with `LiftStatus` enum (7 states)
- New lift states: IDLE, MOVING_UP, MOVING_DOWN, DOORS_OPENING, DOORS_OPEN, DOORS_CLOSING, OUT_OF_SERVICE
- `DOORS_OPENING` state for symmetric door transitions
- `StateTransitionValidator` class to enforce valid state transitions
- Comprehensive unit tests for state machine transitions and validation
- State transition table in README documentation
- ADR-0002 documenting single source of truth architectural decision
- State machine prevents invalid operations (e.g., movement with doors open)
- Logging for invalid state transitions

### Changed
- **Breaking**: `LiftState` refactored to single source of truth pattern
- `LiftState` now stores only `floor` and `status` (direction and doorState are derived)
- Constructor signature changed from `LiftState(floor, direction, doorState, status)` to `LiftState(floor, status)`
- `Direction` and `DoorState` are now computed properties, not stored fields
- `SimulationEngine` refactored to be state-driven with enforced transitions
- State transitions are validated before being applied
- Door behavior is now symmetric (both opening and closing are transitional states)

### Fixed
- Eliminated possibility of invalid state combinations (e.g., moving with doors open)
- Lift can no longer move when doors are open (enforced by state machine)
- Invalid state transitions are prevented and logged
- Door state changes are now controlled by the state machine
- Removed redundant state storage reducing memory usage

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Use enum comparison for door state checks in the demo output

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Make nearest-floor selection deterministic with a tie-breaker for equidistant requests
- Added tests covering deterministic behavior for equidistant requests

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Initialize the simulation state at the configured minimum floor
- Normalize direction to idle when movement is requested at top or bottom floors
- Added tests for non-zero minimum floor initialization and boundary direction behavior

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- Initial tick-based simulation engine
- `SimulationEngine` class for advancing time in discrete ticks
- `LiftState` immutable domain model (floor, direction, door state)
- `Action` enum for lift actions (MOVE_UP, MOVE_DOWN, OPEN_DOOR, CLOSE_DOOR, IDLE)
- `LiftController` interface for pluggable controller strategies
- `NaiveLiftController` implementation (services nearest request first)
- `SimpleLiftController` alternative basic implementation
- Support for `CarCall` (requests from inside the lift)
- Support for `HallCall` (requests from a floor with direction)
- `Direction` enum (UP, DOWN, IDLE)
- `DoorState` enum (OPEN, CLOSED)
- Console-based demo in `Main.java`
- Unit tests for `SimulationEngine` and `NaiveLiftController`
- Maven build configuration with Java 17 and JUnit 5
- Basic project documentation (README, CHANGELOG, ADR-0001)
- EditorConfig file for consistent code formatting across IDEs and platforms

### Design Decisions
- Chose tick-based simulation for predictable, testable time advancement
- Immutable state objects to avoid bugs from shared mutable state
- Separated controller logic from simulation engine for flexibility
