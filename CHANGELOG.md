# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- Introduced formal lift state machine with `LiftStatus` enum
- New lift states: IDLE, MOVING_UP, MOVING_DOWN, DOORS_OPEN, DOORS_CLOSING, OUT_OF_SERVICE
- `StateTransitionValidator` class to enforce valid state transitions
- Comprehensive unit tests for state machine transitions and validation
- State machine prevents invalid operations (e.g., movement with doors open)
- Logging for invalid state transitions

### Changed
- `LiftState` class now includes `status` field of type `LiftStatus`
- `SimulationEngine` refactored to be state-driven with enforced transitions
- State transitions are validated before being applied
- Door closing behavior now properly enforced by state machine

### Fixed
- Lift can no longer move when doors are open (enforced by state machine)
- Invalid state transitions are prevented and logged
- Door state changes are now controlled by the state machine

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Use enum comparison for door state checks in the demo output

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed
- Make nearest-floor selection deterministic with a tie-breaker for equidistant requests
- Added tests covering deterministic behavior for equidistant requests

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- Initialize the simulation state at the configured minimum floor
- Normalize direction to idle when movement is requested at top or bottom floors
- Added tests for non-zero minimum floor initialization and boundary direction behavior

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- Initial tick-based simulation engine
- `SimulationEngine` class for advancing time in discrete ticks
- `LiftState` immutable domain model (floor, direction, door state)
- `Action` enum for lift actions (MOVE_UP, MOVE_DOWN, OPEN_DOOR, CLOSE_DOOR, IDLE)
- `LiftController` interface for pluggable controller strategies
- `NaiveLiftController` implementation (services nearest request first)
- `SimpleLiftController` alternative basic implementation
- Support for `CarCall` (requests from inside the lift)
- Support for `HallCall` (requests from a floor with direction)
- `Direction` enum (UP, DOWN, IDLE)
- `DoorState` enum (OPEN, CLOSED)
- Console-based demo in `Main.java`
- Unit tests for `SimulationEngine` and `NaiveLiftController`
- Maven build configuration with Java 17 and JUnit 5
- Basic project documentation (README, CHANGELOG, ADR-0001)
- EditorConfig file for consistent code formatting across IDEs and platforms

### Design Decisions
- Chose tick-based simulation for predictable, testable time advancement
- Immutable state objects to avoid bugs from shared mutable state
- Separated controller logic from simulation engine for flexibility
