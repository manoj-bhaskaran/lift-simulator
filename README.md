# Lift Controller

A Java-based simulation of lift (elevator) controllers.

This project is developed iteratively to model:
- Lift state and movement
- Controller decision logic
- Request handling (hall calls and car calls)
- Time-based simulation

Initial versions are text-based and focus on correctness and design clarity.
