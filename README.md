# Lift Simulator

A Java-based simulation of lift (elevator) controllers with a focus on correctness and design clarity.

## Version

Current version: **0.3.0**

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history.

## What is this?

The Lift Simulator is an iterative project to model and test lift controller algorithms. It simulates:
- Lift state and movement (floor position, direction, door state)
- Controller decision logic (choosing which floor to service next)
- Request handling (hall calls and car calls)
- Time-based simulation using discrete ticks

The simulation is text-based and designed for clarity over visual appeal.

## Features

The current version (v0.3.0) implements:
- **Formal lift state machine** with 7 explicit states (IDLE, MOVING_UP, MOVING_DOWN, DOORS_OPENING, DOORS_OPEN, DOORS_CLOSING, OUT_OF_SERVICE)
- **Single source of truth**: LiftStatus is the only stored state, all other properties are derived
- **State transition validation** ensuring only valid state changes occur
- **Symmetric door behavior**: Both opening and closing are modeled as transitional states
- **Single lift simulation** operating between configurable floor ranges
- **Tick-based simulation engine** that advances time in discrete steps
- **Simulation clock** powering deterministic tick progression
- **Configurable travel and door transition durations** to model time per floor and door cycles
- **NaiveLiftController** - A simple controller that services the nearest pending request
- **Console output** displaying tick-by-tick lift state (floor, direction, door state, status)
- **Basic request types**: Car calls (from inside the lift) and hall calls (from a floor)
- **Safety enforcement**: Lift cannot move with doors open, doors cannot open while moving

Future iterations will add multi-lift systems, smarter algorithms, and more realistic constraints.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6 or later

## Development Setup

This project includes an `.editorconfig` file to maintain consistent code formatting across different editors and IDEs. Most modern editors support EditorConfig either natively or through plugins:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Built-in support (no plugin needed)
- **VS Code**: Install the "EditorConfig for VS Code" extension
- **Eclipse**: Install the EditorConfig Eclipse plugin
- **Vim/Neovim**: Install the editorconfig-vim plugin

The configuration enforces:
- UTF-8 encoding
- LF line endings (ensures compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS)
- 4-space indentation for Java and XML files
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Final newline insertion

## Building the Project

Compile the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

To build a JAR package:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

The packaged JAR will be in `target/lift-simulator-0.3.0.jar`.

## Running the Simulation

Run the demo simulation:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.liftsimulator.Main"
```

Or run directly after building:

```bash
java -cp target/lift-simulator-0.3.0.jar com.liftsimulator.Main
```

The demo runs a pre-configured scenario with several lift requests and displays the simulation state at each tick.

## Configuring Tick Timing

You can model travel and door timing by using the extended `SimulationEngine` constructor:

```java
SimulationEngine engine = new SimulationEngine(
    controller,
    0,
    10,
    3, // travelTicksPerFloor
    2  // doorTransitionTicks
);
```

Travel ticks specify how many ticks it takes to move one floor. Door transition ticks apply to opening and closing.

## Running Tests

Execute all tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
mvn test jacoco:report
```

## Lift State Machine

The lift uses a **single source of truth** pattern where `LiftStatus` is the only stored state - all other properties (direction, door state) are derived from it.

### States

| State | Description | Direction | Doors |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **IDLE** | Stationary, ready to accept requests | IDLE | CLOSED |
| **MOVING_UP** | Traveling upward between floors | UP | CLOSED (locked) |
| **MOVING_DOWN** | Traveling downward between floors | DOWN | CLOSED (locked) |
| **DOORS_OPENING** | Doors in process of opening (transitional) | IDLE | CLOSED |
| **DOORS_OPEN** | Doors fully open, passengers can enter/exit | IDLE | OPEN |
| **DOORS_CLOSING** | Doors in process of closing (transitional) | IDLE | CLOSED |
| **OUT_OF_SERVICE** | Offline for maintenance or emergency | IDLE | CLOSED |

### State Transition Table

| From ↓ / To → | IDLE | MOVING_UP | MOVING_DOWN | DOORS_OPENING | DOORS_OPEN | DOORS_CLOSING | OUT_OF_SERVICE |
|---------------|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **IDLE** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **MOVING_UP** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **MOVING_DOWN** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **DOORS_OPENING** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **DOORS_OPEN** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **DOORS_CLOSING** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **OUT_OF_SERVICE** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

### Safety Constraints

The state machine enforces critical safety rules:
- **Cannot move with doors open**: DOORS_OPEN/DOORS_OPENING/DOORS_CLOSING cannot transition to MOVING_UP/MOVING_DOWN
- **Cannot reverse direction**: Must stop (IDLE) before changing direction
- **Cannot open doors while moving**: MOVING_UP/MOVING_DOWN must first transition to IDLE (stop), then to DOORS_OPENING
- **Doors must complete transitions**: DOORS_OPENING cannot transition directly to IDLE; must go through DOORS_OPEN → DOORS_CLOSING → IDLE
- **Symmetric door transitions**: Both opening and closing are modeled as separate states
- **All transitions validated**: Invalid transitions are prevented and logged

Valid transitions are managed by the `StateTransitionValidator` class, which ensures the lift operates safely and predictably.
